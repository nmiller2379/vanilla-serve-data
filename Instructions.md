# Serving a simple form
This activity is designed to help you practice serving a simple form with an Express.js server. To complete this activity, work in a copy of your `express-template`. 

1. **Form Layout**
   - As a user, I want to see a form with fields for First Name, Last Name, and Age, so that I can enter my personal information.

2. **Form Submission**
   - As a user, I want the form to have a "Submit" button, so that I can submit my information after filling out the form (We'll come back to this functionality later).

3. **Form Styling**
   - As a user, I want the form to be visually appealing with styled input fields and buttons, so that the form is easy to use and navigate.

4. **Server Setup**
   - As a user, I want to access the form by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/form`, so that I can fill out and submit my information.

5. **Static File Serving**
   - As a developer, I want to serve the form's HTML and CSS files from an Express server, so that users can access the form and view it with the appropriate styles.

6. **Form Validation (Optional)**
   - As a user, I want to be notified if any fields are left empty when I submit the form, so that I can ensure all necessary information is provided. (We will hand this data later as we build out our server.)
